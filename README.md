Coefplot is a package for plotting the coefficients and standard errors
from a variety of models. Currently lm, glm, glmnet, maxLik, rxLinMod,
rxGLM and rxLogit are supported.

The package is designed for S3 dispatch from the functions coefplot and
getModelInfo to make for easy additions of new models.
