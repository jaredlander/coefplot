\arguments{
\item{model}{The model to plot.}

\item{title}{The name of the plot, if NULL then no name is given}

\item{xlab}{The x label}

\item{ylab}{The y label}

\item{innerCI}{How wide the inner confidence interval should be, normally 1 standard deviation.  If 0, then there will be no inner confidence interval.}

\item{outerCI}{How wide the outer confidence interval should be, normally 2 standard deviations.  If 0, then there will be no outer confidence interval.}

\item{lwdInner}{The thickness of the inner confidence interval}

\item{lwdOuter}{The thickness of the outer confidence interval}

\item{pointSize}{Size of coefficient point}

\item{color}{The color of the points and lines}

\item{shape}{The shape of the points}

\item{cex}{The text size multiplier, currently not used}

\item{textAngle}{The angle for the coefficient labels, 0 is horizontal}

\item{numberAngle}{The angle for the value labels, 0 is horizontal}

\item{zeroColor}{The color of the line indicating 0}

\item{zeroLWD}{The thickness of the 0 line}

\item{zeroType}{The type of 0 line, 0 will mean no line}

\item{facet}{logical; If the coefficients should be faceted by the variables, numeric coefficients (including the intercept) will be one facet.  Currently not available.}

\item{scales}{The way the axes should be treated in a faceted plot.  Can be c("fixed", "free", "free_x", "free_y").  Currently not available.}

\item{sort}{Determines the sort order of the coefficients.  Possible values are c("natural", "normal", "magnitude", "size", "alphabetical")}

\item{decreasing}{logical; Whether the coefficients should be ascending or descending}

\item{numeric}{logical; If true and factors has exactly one value, then it is displayed in a horizontal graph with constinuous confidence bounds.  Currently not available.}

\item{fillColor}{The color of the confidence bounds for a numeric factor.  Currently not available.}

\item{alpha}{The transparency level of the numeric factor's confidence bound.  Currently not available.}

\item{horizontal}{logical; If the plot should be displayed horizontally.  Currently not available.}

\item{factors}{Vector of factor variables that will be the only ones shown}

\item{only}{logical; If factors has a value this determines how interactions are treated.  True means just that variable will be shown and not its interactions.  False means interactions will be included.}

\item{shorten}{logical or character; If \code{FALSE} then coefficients for factor levels will include their variable name.  If \code{TRUE} coefficients for factor levels will be stripped of their variable names.  If a character vector of variables only coefficients for factor levels associated with those variables will the variable names stripped.  Currently not available.}

\item{intercept}{logical; Whether the Intercept coefficient should be plotted}

\item{interceptName}{Specifies name of intercept it case it is not the default of "(Intercept").}

\item{coefficients}{A character vector specifying which factor coefficients to keep.  It will keep all levels and any interactions, even if those are not listed.}

\item{predictors}{A character vector specifying which coefficients to keep.  Each individual coefficient can be specfied.  Use predictors to specify entire factors.}

\item{strict}{If TRUE then predictors will only be matched to its own coefficients, not its interactions}

\item{newNames}{Named character vector of new names for coefficients}

\item{plot}{logical; If the plot should be drawn, if false then a data.frame of the values will be returned}

\item{\dots}{Arguments passed on to other functions}
}
\value{
If \code{plot} is \code{TRUE} then a \code{\link{ggplot}} object is returned.  Otherwise a \code{\link{data.frame}} listing coeffcients and confidence bands is returned.

\details{
A graphical display of the coefficients and standard errors from a fitted model

\code{\link{coefplot}} is the S3 generic method for plotting the coefficients from a fitted model.

This method also plots coefficients from glm (using coefplot.lm) and rxLinMod models (through a redirection from coefplot.rxLinMod)
}
\examples{

data(diamonds)
head(diamonds)
model1 <- lm(price ~ carat + cut*color, data=diamonds)
model2 <- lm(price ~ carat*color, data=diamonds)
coefplot(model1)
coefplot(model2)
coefplot(model1, predictors="color")
coefplot(model1, predictors="color", strict=TRUE)
coefplot(model1, coefficients=c("(Intercept)", "color.Q"))
